Hi, I'm Divyesh Patel. It has come to my attention that you're using my Google authentication credentials and the Vuexy theme in your project titled "React-panel."
Please be aware that I have access to the latest source code of your project, and I am aware that you're engaged in freelance work. You need to either compensate me and remove my credentials from all locations, or I will take action with the source code.

Additionally, I would like to inform you that the Vuexy template theme is officially licensed to Zignuts Technolab. Zignuts Technolab reserves the right to take appropriate legal action against you.
